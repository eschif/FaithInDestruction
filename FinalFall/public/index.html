        And the soul has a power in the eyes which makes the eye so sensitive and delicate and too fastidious to accept things in the coarse-grained mode they have themselves, but they must first be filtered and refined by light and air, owing to the presence in it of the soul. Another power in the soul is that wherewith she thinks. This power is able to picture in itself things which are not there, so that I can see the things as well as I see them with my eyes, or even better. I can see a rose in winter when there are no roses, therefore with this power the soul produces things from the non-existent, like God who creates things out of nothing!

        towards the unconscious, the only accessible source of religious experience. This is certainly not to say that
        what we call the unconscious is identical with God or is set up in his place. It is the medium from which the
        religious experience seems to flow. As to what the further cause of such an experience may be, the answer to
        this lies beyond the range of human knowledge. Knowledge of God is a transcendental problem.

        Before my eye can see the painting on the wall this must be filtered through the air, and in a still more tenuous form be borne into my fantasy,, to be assimilated by my understanding...What the eye perceives has to be conveyed to it by means, in images. If there were no means we should see nothing. If an angel sees another angel or anything that God has made, he does so by some means. But himself and God he sees immediately. It is only by the senses that the soul is roused and the idea of wisdom naturally imprinted in her...My soul is undivided; also, it is entire in each member. Where my eye sees my ear does not hear. My bodily hearing and sight are engineered in the mind. Light gives my eye a sense of color which is lacking to the soul by reasons of its being a defect. All the outward senses are alive to, if the spirit is to take it in, must be raised up by the angel: he imprints it in the upper portion of the soul.
